# Note: All items MUST be followed by a quantity!
# All kit names should be lower case, and will be treated as lower in permissions/costs.
# Syntax: - name[:durability] amount [enchantment:level]... [itemmeta:value]...

# To make the kit execute a command, add /<command> to the items list. Use {PLAYER} to specify the player receiving the kit.
